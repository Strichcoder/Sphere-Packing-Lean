\subsection{Lattices and Periodic packings}

\begin{definition}\label{IsZlattice}\lean{IsZlattice}\leanok
  We say that an additive subgroup $\Lambda \leq \R^d$ is a \emph{lattice} if it is discrete and its $\R$-span contains all the elements of $\R^d$.
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}\label{PeriodicSpherePacking}\lean{PeriodicSpherePacking}\uses{SpherePacking, IsZlattice}\leanok
  We say that a sphere packing $\Pa(X)$ is ($\Lambda$-)\emph{periodic} if there exists a lattice $\Lambda \subset \R^d$ such that for all $x \in X$ and $y \in \Lambda$, $x + y \in X$ (ie, $X$ is $\Lambda$-periodic).
\end{definition}

\begin{lemma}\label{PeriodicSpherePacking.instAddAction}\lean{PeriodicSpherePacking.instAddAction}\uses{PeriodicSpherePacking}\leanok
  If $\Pa(X)$ is a $\Lambda$-periodic sphere packing, then $\Lambda$ acts on $X$ by translation.
\end{lemma}
\begin{proof}\leanok
  This is immediate from the definition of a periodic sphere packing.
\end{proof}

There is a natural definition of density for periodic sphere packings, namely the ``local'' density of balls in a fundamental domain. However, \textit{a priori} the density of sphere packing above need not to coincide with this alternative definition. In \cref{theorem:psp-density}, we will prove that this is the case.

Now that we have simplified the process of computing the packing densities of specific packings, we can simplify that of computing the sphere packing constant. It turns out that once again, periodicity is key.

\begin{definition}\label{def:Periodic-sphere-packing-constant}\uses{SpherePacking.density, PeriodicSpherePacking}\notready
    The periodic sphere packing constant is defined to be
    $$ \Delta_{d}^{\text{periodic}} := \sup_{\substack{P \subset \R^d \\ \text{periodic packing}}} \Delta_P$$
\end{definition}

\begin{theorem}\label{periodic-packing-optimal}\uses{SpherePacking.density, def:Periodic-sphere-packing-constant}\notready
    For all $d$, the periodic sphere packing constant in $\R^d$ is equal to the sphere packing constant in $\R^d$.
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
  \todo{State this in Lean (ready).}
  \todo{Fill in proof here (see~\cite[Appendix A]{ElkiesCohn})}
\end{proof}

Thus, one can show a sphere packing to be optimal by showing its density to be equal to the \emph{periodic} sphere packing constant instead of the regular sphere packing constant. The determination of the periodic constant is easier than that of the general constant, as we shall see when investigating the Linear Programming bounds derived by Cohn and Elkies in~\cite{ElkiesCohn}.
