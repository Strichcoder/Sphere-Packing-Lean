In 2003 Cohn and Elkies \cite{ElkiesCohn}  developed  linear programming bounds that apply directly to sphere packings. The goal of this section is to formalize the Cohn__Elkies linear programming bound.

The following theorem is the key result of \cite{ElkiesCohn}. (The original theorem is stated for a   class of functions more general then Schwartz functions)
\begin{theorem}\label{thm_Cohn_Elkies}\uses{def_Fourier_Transform, thm_Poisson_summation_formula, SpherePacking.Density}\notready
(Cohn, Elkies \cite{ElkiesCohn}) Suppose that  $f:\R^d\to\R$ is a Schwartz function that is not identically zero and satisfies the following conditions:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_Cohn_Elkies_condition_1}f(x)\leq 0\mbox{ for } \|x\|\geq 1\end{equation} and
\begin{equation}\label{eqn_Cohn_Elkies_condition_2}\widehat{f}(x)\geq0\mbox{ for all } x\in\R^d.\end{equation}
  Then the density of $d$_dimensional
  sphere packings is bounded above by $$\frac{f(0)}{\widehat{f}(0)}\cdot \frac{\pi^{\frac{d}{2}}}{2^d\,\Gamma(\textstyle \frac{d}{2}+1)}.$$
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
To be included.

The main step in our proof of Theorem \ref{Main} is the explicit  construction of an optimal function. It will be convenient for us to scale this function by $\sqrt{2}$.
\begin{theorem}\label{thm_g}\uses{thm_g1}
There exists a radial Schwartz function $g:\R^8\to\R$ which satisfies:
\begin{align}
g(x)&\leq 0\mbox{ for } \|x\|\geq \sqrt{2} \label{eqn_g1}\\
\widehat{g}(x)&\geq0\mbox{ for all } x\in\R^8\label{eqn_g2}\\
g(0)&=\widehat{g}(0)=1.\label{eqn_g3}
\end{align}
\end{theorem}
Theorem \ref{thm_Cohn_Elkies} applied to the optimal function $f(x)=g(x/\sqrt{2})$ immediately implies Theorem \ref{Main}.
